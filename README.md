# GitHub Avatar Downloader

## Problem Statement

Given a GitHub repository name and owner, download all the contributors' profile images and save them to a subdirectory: 
```
`avatars/`.
```
## Expected Usage

This program should be executed from the command line, in the following manner:

```
`node download_avatars.js jquery jquery`
```

... and that's about it. This is the first project given to us in the junior web development cohot. Feel free to fork or clone if you need a template for an avatar downloader from another website.
